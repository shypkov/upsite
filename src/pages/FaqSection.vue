              "Staking" is like bank deposit, and you use digital assets to get rewards from
              network, like bank rewards you with fixed percent to your deposit. It's secure, fault
              resistant, and fair.
            </p>
            <p> How does it look like? </p>
            <p>
              You are the delegator and you delegate tokens you own to one of the validators who process transactions.
              You dont send assets to validator, you just delegate. The assets is always on your wallet when you delegate.
              Validators only make work(voting for right chain) in network and receive rewards like miners in BtC.
              When work of validator is done (end of the epoch) validator achieves rewards for himself and delegators as well.

          <div class="faq-item__title">What is a Stake Pool?</div>
          <div class="faq-item__body">
            <p>
              Stake pool is a digital space to earn rewards with other delegators. "Stake pools" gives easies
              way to stake trusted validators, and it's more easy than miner pools. Users deposit
              SOL or other assets, and can always check and claim rewards. Stakepools could be liquid and solid.
              Liquid stake pool allows you to use unlocked synthezied assets in equal quantity that you staked.
              Liquid pools has it's risks when you have to back all the synthezied actives before unstake.
              Cryptosapiens is a web3 provider which alows you easily select network with best validator and stake assets
